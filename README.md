# RE-Shotgun-Controller  
This project uses the Arduino pro micro, to emulate a keyboard and a mouse, to make a videogame controller.   
You can aim with the controller in your hands and it will make the game screen move, you can use the reload pump on the controller to reload in the game, you can use the shooting trigger on the controller to shot in the game. There are also other functions on the controller with other buttons, like moving the character on the screen with the joystick mounted on the controller.  
The project theme was Resident Evil, but you can play any shooter game on the computer.  
Components : Joystick, reed switch, 3 buttons and the mpu6050 (to aim).
